There are many misconceptions and booby traps in the registration and protection of your IP. For example, if you think you have global patent protection, you are almost certainly wrong, since no such thing exists. Similarly, if you do not have China protection of trade-marks, copyrights and patents, chances are that if your marks and patents have commercial value, someone else will have them registered in China, which is a 'first filer' country. Let us review your status and make recommendations before you begin in China, or before you get into difficulties. If you are already here and need help, our legal staff can advise, assist or execute for you. If you are not here we can assist with a defense strategy which will protect you in the future.

Your business will only be as good as the people you select to work with you. As you might expect, the process is somewhat different in China. People can be tied to their home town and can be tied to their current employer in a number of ways. These issues can be dealt with successfully with our level of knowhow.

In judging the strength of an individual's education, you need knowledge of not only people, but also the Chinese educational system so as to evaluate the depth of their study. As well, you need to look at their year of graduation to assess the level of teaching skills available when they were in school.

We have hired thousands of educated Chinese for numerous businesses and can assist in your familiarization with this process.

It is important that you establish a strong banking relationship early on in the planning process. We have extensive experience in both PRC and Hong Kong banking arenas. It is important also to balance your currency inflows and outflows. We can assist you by arranging financing in various currencies, including the local RMB. This can be a difficult and time-consuming process and our experience will improve your chances of success.

Also, we can assist you in currency balancing by helping with localization of inputs into your process and business. We already have many contacts in PRC and have access to information that is not otherwise easily available

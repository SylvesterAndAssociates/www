This agreement between Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the PRC Tax Department, although entitled as an elimination of tax, is in fact an enabling document which will allow the mainland tax authority to penetrate your tax records and other documents in Hong Kong and will result in a significantly higher tax payment for those doing business on both sides of the PRC/Hong Kong border and using spit personal and corporate earnings recording. In fact, the mainland authorities will collect their much higher rates of tax where such common practices are used.

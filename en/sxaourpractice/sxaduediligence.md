If you are planning an investment or a purchase in China, it is critical that you complete your due diligence process first. We have seen the potentially devastating results of not doing so up front. You must look under every rock and turn over every stone to be assured that you will not be blind-sided in the future.

We will be happy to execute or assist you in this process using our experienced professionals to the point where investors will express satisfaction with the process.

Tax planning on a multi-national multi-jurisdiction basis is extremely important both from a personal and a corporate standpoint. If not done properly, wealth protection and governmental difficulties will result. We have structured many plans which can result in significantly lower tax liabilities and avoided downstream problems and liabilities.

With the introduction of the Double Tax Agreement between Hong Kong SAR and China, a well kept secret is that many previously used procedures to reduce tax are no longer legal. Those who do not comply with this new legislation will find themselves in difficulty.

From a corporate standpoint, it is essential that proper structuring, keeping in mind transfer pricing regulations on inter-company transactions and similar important issues, be considered so that the most advantageous structure is created in the beginning. It is easier and more efficient to do it right the first time. We can help you develop the optimum arrangement for your unique situation

You will want to do a feasibility study of your proposed business entry into China. View it like the study you would give a roadmap before starting out on a long journey in a strange territory. This process will require an examination and determination of all aspects of your business, such as market analysis, manufacturing or marketing inputs, manpower issues, location, localization, and so on. We have done many such studies and can assist you and your staff in the completion of this process.

There are many audiences for this document both internal and external and we can ensure that it is complete, informative, and instructive. We have worked with clients who executed this process using their own staff exclusively. This is an acceptable way to do this, but in some cases has produced an imperfect and perhaps even misleading result. Our experienced eyes can help to improve the process

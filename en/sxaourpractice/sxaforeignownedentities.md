Originally intended for manufacturing companies only, the application of this form of enterprise was broadened in 2004 so that it could be used by wholesalers, retailers, service providers and other non-manufacturing applications. This change also provided the ability for WFOE companies to obtain import and export licenses. There are (50) steps and (45) individual filings which are necessary in the process of formation, but once properly done, almost any business activity is permitted. The essential element is to' get it right' the first time.

We can not only get you through the formation exercise painlessly, but as part of our service we will tutor your selected staff in the exact procedures required to tip-toe through the maze of regulations and minefields that need to be negotiated.

One common form of enterprise establishment is the Joint Venture. This is established by finding a Chinese party who are willing to invest with you and to cooperate in some form in the organizing and management of the undertaking.

There are a number of things that are critical to a successful J/V, not the least of which is selecting a good partner. A mistake at this stage can cause innumerable difficulties and even abject failure. The negotiations required with your potential partner can be a difficult and frustrating experience as can the legal processes required to complete this form of endeavor.

With our experience and versatility we can assist you through this process as well as providing the legal requirements and services.

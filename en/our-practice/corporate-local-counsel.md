Rather than supplant existing corporate or in-house counsel, we generally work in tandem with them to ensure a more full understanding of the Pearl River Delta and Greater China is presented as clients enter or expand in this market.

Our most common scenario when working with foreign clients doing business in China is that we speak directly with the shareholders, business development executives, human resources professionals and chief financial officers -- in addition to working with their primary counsel. We do so, for we need to know what clients are planning now, but because of the unique corporate formation environment here, we also need to know where they want to be in five and ten years.

In a process of collaboration with counsel that clients are already comfortable with, we provide cultural, legal, social and language translation. In short, we find out where you are and where you want to go -- then we help you draw the mapâ€¦

Whether it is securing intellectual property as you prepare to enter this environment for the first time or to engage in the process of mediation or arbitration on issues gone awry, we work with you to ensure you have all the information your company needs to make intelligent choice

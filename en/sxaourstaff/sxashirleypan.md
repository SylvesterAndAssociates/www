After graduating from Heilongjiang University in 1986, Shirley became the Human Resources Administrator for the State-Owned Enterprise Heilongjiang Chemicals Raw Materials Group Corporation. While there she was the Secretary of the Communist Youth League and she still maintains her relationships there and with Heilongjiang Chemicals.

Following her time in Harbin, Shirley managed and worked in a diverse group of businesses including: Advertising Ltd.'s North Asia Group; was the general manager assistant for New Industries Medical Development Co., Ltd; manager for the chief and the directorate's secretary for New Yuexi Group Co., Ltd.; president's assistant for Mings Vision Medical Co. Ltd., the general manager assistant for PDT Medical Co. Ltd; and also vice chief for PDT Clinical Research Center of The First Military Medical University Guangzhou Nanfang Hospital. This last experience was quite unique in that PDT is bringing Chinese designed, world-class cancer remediation technology to all of China via its clinics. Shirley has been recognized and honored by all of her past employers for her diligent work, flexibility in a shifting regulatory environment, excellent organization skills and overall energy brought to any project.

She has rich management ability and is familiar with medical investment in China both in a purely Chinese context, but also in mixed equity and technology settings. She was also responsible for establishing the framework, from the ground up, for PDT Medical Company and their now growing number of clinics.

Sylvester & Associates came to ShenZhen a year before China formalized it's entry into the WTO and has engaged in a Chinese business, foreign direct investment, and intellectual property practice, representing a wide range of investment projects and transactions for clients. We advise shareholders and management in their analysis and decision-making relating to tax, regulatory, IP and other legal requirements, while also presenting the commercial considerations and rapid changes in this environment.

The firm regularly engages in commercial and financial transactions in China, including M&A, oil & gas service companies, commercial and residential real estate, foreign direct investment, joint ventures and related tax matters. The firm has a particular focus on technology and high technology matters, as more foreign companies enter the Chinese market each year. Most of the new companies entering China are taking advantage of the liberalization spawned from China's accession agreement to the WTO.

The firm deals with a wide range of legal and administrative issues arising from the import & export of goods, delivery of services and financial transactions, including foreign exchange control, tax, licensing, patent, stock options, customs and related intellectual property. In late 2004, together with several Chinese investigation companies, we also began coordinating investigations and enforcement actions with State authorities for United States and European based clients with IP infringement issues.

When arbitration and mediation matters are brought to us we also provide local representation and, this year alone we have represented clients with matters before CIETAC in ShenZhen and Beijing, the Maritime Court in ShenZhen, the People's Court in ShenZhen and the Intermediate People's Court Appellate Body here in ShenZhen.
